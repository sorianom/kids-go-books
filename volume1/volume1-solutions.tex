 \begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay]
    \draw (4.8,1) node[font=\tiny] {Black captures:};
    \draw (5.0,3.33) node[font=\tiny] {White captures: \blackstone};
 \end{tikzpicture}

White has \ul{$27$} $-$ \ul{$0$} $+$ \ul{$6.5$} $=$ \ul{$33.5$} points.

Black has \ul{$24$} $-$ \ul{$2$} $=$ \ul{$22$} points.

\ul{White} wins.

If you consider Komi as $7.5$, White has $34.5$ points.
