# My First Book of Go Exercises

This book has a series of exercises to learn fundamental concepts of the Go game. It starts with basic captures across the board, but it also gives a first intuition towards important concepts such as ladders, nets, eyes, kos, and counting. The exercises should be straight-forward if you have Go knowledge, but a solution sheet is provided as a separate document.

It is possible to find basic Go problems on-line. However, usually many parents want to limit the time kids spend in front of a screen. Hence, my intention with this book was to give kids an opportunity to practice Go (and Math) in a more classical ``paper-and-pencil'' setting. Therefore, the original intention is for the book to be printed, to allow the kids to draw in the pages. However, of course, playing it with a pdf editor (e.g., in a tablet) is also possible.

You will find in the middle of the book a ``Capture Go'' board. Capture Go is a great introduction to Go, and it can be entirely played by drawing stones. I would recommend printing and laminating a 9x9 Go Board with white background, and playing Capture Go by drawing stones over it using white board markers. The stones can be erased afterwards with a wipe, allowing many games to be played by drawing. In that way kids can draw funny faces in the stones, balloons with dialogues, etc, allowing them to play Go and express their creativity and imagination at the same time. After the game is over, most often the board also evolves into a full drawing. That will make it really fun for them!
